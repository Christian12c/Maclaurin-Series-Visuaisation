# Maclaurin Series Visuaisation

The project was created to visualise how the addition of higher order Maclaurin series terms gives better and better approximations to the original function.

How to use the Visualisation:
When the executable file is run, the following prompt will come up : " Enter the Maclaurin Series function as shown in README.md". To generate the graphs, the following input has to be entered: MaclaurinSeries(f(x), n, a, b)
